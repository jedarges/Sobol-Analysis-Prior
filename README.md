# Sobol-Analysis-Prior
The code provided here accompanies the manuscript "Variance-based sensitivity of Bayesian inverse problems to the prior distribution" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18488) by J.E. Darges, A. Alexanderian, and P.A. Gremaud
and is intended to allow for replication of the results presented within.

# Test file
<code>sabyes.mlx</code> is a <code>MATLAB</code> Live Script that contains all experiments in one file. 
The Live Script file functions similarly to a <code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter worksheet. Code should be run one section at a time, but also sequentially depend on each other. 

# Other files
The folders in this repository contain other scripts and functions required to run <code>sabyes.mlx</code>. The PCE associated files includes those for the SPGL1 algorithm of E. van den Berg and M. P. Friedlander, "Probing the Pareto frontier for basis pursuit solutions." This software comes from the SPGL1 repository (https://friedlander.io/spgl1).
